# Gameplay Tuning

Balancing a game (speed, damage, jump height) is impossible without playing it.

## The Workflow

1.  Select your Player or Enemy character.
2.  Press **Play**.
3.  While controlling the character, adjust:
    *   `Move Speed`
    *   `Jump Force`
    *   `Attack Damage`
4.  Feel the difference immediately.
5.  Repeat until the controls feel tight and responsive.
6.  **Don't memorize the numbers.**
7.  Exit Play Mode and use **PlayModeSaver** to commit the final values.

## Using Presets for Difficulty

You can tune the game for "Easy Mode", save a **Preset**, then tune it for "Hard Mode" and save another. This lets you quickly swap balance configurations.
